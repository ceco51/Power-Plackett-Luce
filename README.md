# Power-Plackett-Luce

A simple R script for conducting Monte Carlo-based power analysis for the Plackett-Luce model. The script generates \(N\) rankings through a weighted (biased) sampling scheme over all possible rankings (permutations of \(n\) items) and fits the Plackett-Luce model to estimate effect sizes. It includes functionality to filter effect sizes based on a specified minimum effect size of interest. Additionally, support for parallel processing enhances computational efficiency.
